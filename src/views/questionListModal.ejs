                        1 .Do you know from what English people get their family names? Finish
                        the sentences after you read the story.    Everyone has a family name.
                        But what does it mean? From what do family names come?
                        First, some family names come from the place of their homes.
                        If a man lives on or near a hill, his family name may be Hill. In
                        England people’s names may be Wood, Lake, because they
                        live near the wood or lake.
                        Second, family names come from a person’s job. If a person is a
                        cook, he may be Cook.    Third, many people get their family
                        names from
                        their father’s given name. If you hear the name “Jackson”, you know
                        that he is the son of Jack.
